# telegram-ai-analytics

This is a Python application that aggregates news from Telegram public news channels, analyzes them using a local language model (LM) [Gemma2](https://ollama.com/library/gemma2) via [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) + [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), and outputs the result through a web API to a local web page with various filtering methods.

## How it works

The application uses the Telegram Bot API to retrieve news messages from public Telegram channels. It then analyzes these messages using the local LM Gemma2 via "Open WebUI + Ollama" and outputs the result through a web API to a local web page with various filtering methods.

### Web Page

The web page displays the latest news articles aggregated from public Telegram channels. Users can filter the results by country, hashtag, category, priority, source, date range, and sort order. The web page also allows users to view detailed information about each news article, such as the author, publication date, and a summary of the content.
